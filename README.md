# Game Engine in C

Everything is in the title, this project is an attempt to write a game engine in C.

## How to get the project

You can clone it but, you will need the submodules that go with it:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Gamabunta57/GooE.git
```

If you already have cloned the project but don't have all the submodules:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
